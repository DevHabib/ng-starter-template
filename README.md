# Angular starter Template

**Wehenever we try to start an angular project we waste time to building a perfect angular structure.**
**That's why I thought why don't I create a stracture. Istead of making the structure I can clone it and start working on the app**
## Is't it cool?

### To get the structure
>`git clone https://github.com/DevHabib/ng-starter-template`
### Get inside the folder
>`cd ng-starter-template`
### Switch the branch
>`git branch get-template` then `git checkout get-template`
### install node on the project
> `npm i` or `npm install`

### Run the app
>`ng serve --o` (for opening the browser) or `ng serve` (then type on the browser `localhost:4200/`)
### You can change your port too
>`ng serve --o --port 3000` you can use different port too.

# ENJOY!!
